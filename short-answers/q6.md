# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
element.append lets us place elements as a children within a parents element. For example if we create a UL (parent) we can append Listed Items (children) to that UL. The advantage that .append has over .appendChild is that appendChild only allows youn to add one element at a time whereas append lets you add several at once.
